Hey There!

Cecilia said that ya'll could do with some cloth masks, and Kate has been making some, so here you go!

We seem to be in good health, and Utah is doing pretty good statistically, but you'll probably want to
wash them before you use them, just to be safe.

Hope things are going well, I miss your acquaintance very much.

Very Sincerely,
David & Kate
